                    <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a
                        comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of
                        the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when...

                        Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the
                        most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the
                        little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually
                        proud of that shit.

                <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently
                    than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the
                    exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown.
                    However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite
                    ends.</p>

                <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny
                    of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through
                    the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I
                    will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison
                    and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

                    while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give
                    you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning
                    over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
